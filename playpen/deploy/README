Automated Integration Testing
=============================

Adding a new image
------------------

To add a new image, do the following:

1. Upload the image to Glance (or boot an existing image)
2. Update the image with 'yum update'
3. Install puppet
4. Apply the appropriate puppet module to the instance
5. Confirm everything is as it should be (MongoDB times out on start regularly)
6. Soft reboot the instance (or manually restart everything necessary after the update)
7. Take a snapshot of the instance
8. Add metadata to the image (currently only possible using 'nova image-meta set')
   Something like 'nova image-meta set user=cloud-user distribution=fc21 os_name=Fedora os_version=21'
9. Delete the instance (and maybe the initial image uploaded to Glance, if you want).
